# Diseasecard Microsite

## Microsite of a website designed to find and access genetic and medical information about a disease.

The current context of healthcare and medical research demands constant innovation and technological advancements and, to meet these needs, responsive systems capable of adapting to technological advancements and the increasing availability of data are essential.

Diseasecard, developed at the University of Aveiro, and published in 2003, aimed to aggregate genetic and medical information scattered across various online sources and provide analysis. With the need of updates in the system, due to the continuous evolution of data visualization and technologies, the opportunity to develop a more efficient system has arisen. Therefore, in this project, it is proposed the development of a new software in order to replace Diseasecard.
