# Diseasecard.github.io

## Microsite of a website designed to find and access genetic and medical information about a disease.

Diseasecard is an information retrieval tool designed to access and integrate genetic and medical information for healthcare applications. Through this integrated environment, healthcare professionals can access and correlate data on diseases already available on the internet, scattered across multiple databases. However, with the evolution of new technologies related to information visualization and search, an opportunity has arisen to update this system.
